        <h2>How We Gather at Compass Church</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Compass Church has a simple and intentional rhythm — one designed for real life, real growth, and real impact.
        </p>

        <!-- Row 1: Gather Monthly -->

          <div class="gather-text">
            <h3>We Gather Monthly to Worship and Align</h3>
            <p>
              On the first Sunday of each month, we come together in person to worship, hear God's Word,
              and be reminded of who we are and where God is leading us. These gatherings are focused,
              meaningful, and accessible — created for people who want clarity, encouragement, and direction
              for the season ahead.
            </p>

          <div class="gather-text">
            <h3>We Grow Weekly Through Scripture and Community</h3>
            <p>
              Every Wednesday, we gather online for Bible study. This is where formation happens.
              We ask honest questions, explore Scripture deeply, and learn how faith shapes everyday decisions.
              It's not about information alone — it's about transformation, connection, and consistency.
            </p>

            <h3>We Go Quarterly to Serve and Love Our City</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout the year, we step outside the walls of the church and into the world around us.
              Through intentional outreach, we serve our community, meet real needs, and live out our faith
              in tangible ways. We believe the church doesn't exist just for itself — but for the good of others.

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>The Word of God</summary>
            <p>
              We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, fully inspired and without error in the original manuscripts,
              written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and that it has supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>The Trinity</summary>
            <p>
              We believe that there is one living and true God, eternally existing in three persons, that these are equal
              in every divine perfection, and that they execute distinct but harmonious offices in the work of creation,
              providence and redemption.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>God the Father</summary>
            <p>
              We believe in God, the Father, an infinite, personal spirit, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power and love.
              We believe that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of all people, that He hears and answers prayer,
              and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>Jesus Christ</summary>
            <p>
              We believe in Jesus Christ, God's only begotten Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth,
              sinless life, miracles and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning death, bodily resurrection,
              ascension into heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, and personal visible return to earth.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>The Holy Spirit</summary>
            <p>
              We believe in the Holy Spirit who came forth from the Father and Son to convict the world of sin, righteousness,
              and judgment, and to regenerate, sanctify, and empower all who believe in Jesus Christ. We believe that the
              Holy Spirit indwells every believer in Christ, and that He is an abiding helper, teacher and guide.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>Regeneration</summary>
            <p>
              We believe that all people are sinners by nature and by choice and are, therefore, under condemnation.
              We believe that those who repent of their sins and trust in Jesus Christ as Savior are regenerated by the Holy Spirit.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>The Church</summary>
            <p>
              We believe in the universal church, a living spiritual body of which Christ is the head and all regenerated persons
              are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company of believers in Jesus Christ, baptized on a
              credible profession of faith, and associated for worship, work and fellowship. We believe that God has laid upon
              the members of the local church the primary task of giving the gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>Christian Conduct</summary>
            <p>
              We believe that Christians should live for the glory of God and the well-being of others; that their conduct
              should be blameless before the world; that they should be faithful stewards of their possessions; and that
              they should seek to realize for themselves and others the full stature of maturity in Christ.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="belief-item">
            <summary>The Ordinances</summary>
            <p>
              We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has committed two ordinances to the local church: baptism and the Lord's Supper.
              We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water into the name of the triune God. We believe
              that the Lord's Supper was instituted by Christ for commemoration of His death. We believe that these two ordinances
              should be observed and administered until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.
